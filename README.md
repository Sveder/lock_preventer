# lock_preventer
Simple script to prevent screen from being locked if music is playing.

I've long had this issue where my screen locks even though spotify is playing sound. I couldn't find a solution that does this easily, so this is what AI and me came up with.

I've added it to `shell:startup` so it runs on startup.


Special thanks to the amazing assholes at SuperUser who downvoted my question without having a solution:
